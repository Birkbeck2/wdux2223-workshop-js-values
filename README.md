# How do I complete this assignment?

Welcome! Here's how to get started with this assignment:

1. Double-check that this repository is your personal repository for the assignment, not the original template repository. How can you tell? Your username should be on the end of the repository name.

2. If you don't have a personal repository for the assignment yet, create one by visiting Moodle and clicking the assignment link.

3. Once you've got your personal repository, clone it to your computer, open it in your code editor, and read the files in it for instructions.

4. As you make changes, stage and commit them.

5. When you are ready, push your changes to GitHub. It's OK to push work in progress if you want to save it remotely and come back later, or if you are switching computers. We won't evaluate your code until after the due date.

7. The assignment will be automatically submitted when the due date passes, and instructors will have access even though it's a private repository, because it's set up through GitHub Classrooms.
